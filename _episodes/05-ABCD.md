## ABCD method

As you've seen in the previous exercise, the main background is from clusters produced in pilup interactions.
To estimate the background, we use a fully data-driven background estimation method, the ABCD method, that make use of two independent variables for background: $N_{\text{hits}}$ and $\Delta\phi\text{(cluster, MET)}$.

The ABCD plane is illustrated in Figure 5.1, where bin A is the signal-enhanced region, with large values of $N_{\text{hits}}$ and small values of $\Delta\phi\text{(cluster, MET)}$.
The estimation of the number of events in each bin is expressed by:


$$\\

\begin{align}
N_A &= c_1\times c_2 \times Bkg_C +\mu \times SigA\nonumber\\
N_B &= c_1\times Bkg_C +\mu \times SigB\nonumber\\
N_C &= Bkg_C +\mu \times SigC\nonumber\\
N_D &= c_2\times Bkg_C +\mu \times SigD\nonumber\\
\end{align}

\\$$



where:
* SigA, SigB, SigC, SigD are the number of signal events expected in bin A, B, C, and D, taken from the signal MC prediction.
* $\mu$ is the signal strength (the model parameter of interest)
* $c_1$ is the ratio between background in B and C; $c_2$ is the ratio between background in D and C; Both c1 and c2 are essentially interpreted as nuisance parameters that are unconstrained in the fit.
* BkgC is the number of background events in bin C

## Validation of the ABCD method

We have shown the previous episode that if the background clusters are from pileup interaction than the two variables $N_{\text{hits}}$ and $\Delta\phi\text{(cluster, MET)}$ should be independent of each other.
To validate this assumption and the only background sources are from pileup interactions, we create an out-of-time validation region that is enriched with background and perform ABCD method to check that the prediction from ABCD matches with the observation.

> For this part, open the notebook called `ABCD_validation.ipynb` and define the OOT control region and perform the validation test by scanning both $N_{\text{hits}}$ and $\Delta\phi\text{(cluster, MET)}$ thresholds.
