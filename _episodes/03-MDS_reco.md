title: "MDS Reconstruction"
teaching: 15
exercises: 15
questions:
- "What is Muon Detector Shower (MDS)?"
- "How are MDS reconstructed?"
objectives:
- "Understand how are MDS reconstructed: the input, the algorithm, the output"
- "Illustrate MDS reconstruction"
- "Calculate MDS reconstruction efficiency with respect to LLP decay position"
keypoints:
- "MDS reconstruction efficiency depends on where the LLP decays with respect to the steel, since the decay particles require small amount of steel to initiate the shower and are detected only in the active gas chambers"
