questions:

- "How are MDS reconstructed?"
objectives:
- "Understand how are MDS reconstructed: the input, the algorithm, the output"
- "Visualize MDS reconstruction"
- "Calculate cluster properties"
- "Calculate MDS reconstruction efficiency with respect to LLP decay position"
keypoints:
- "MDS is a cluster of rechits in the muon system, clustered by the DBSCAN algorithm"
- "MDS properties are computed from the input rechits(e.g. position,time & station) and are very powerful of rejecting background"
- "MDS reconstruction efficiency depends on where the LLP decays with respect to the steel, since the decay particles require small amount of steel to initiate the shower and are detected only in the active gas chambers"

## Ingredient of MDS: Rechits 
MDS is a cluster of rechits in the muon system. 
The main reason for using rechit is that rechit provides sufficient **granularity** to capture the high-multiplicity nature of the showers coming from LLPs.

### What is a rechit?

CSCs consist of arrays of positively-charged anode wires crossed with negatively-charged copper cathode strips within a gas volume.
 
When muons pass through, they knock electrons off the gas atoms, which flock to the anode wires creating an avalanche of electrons. 

Positive ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles to the wire direction.

Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two position coordinates for each passing particle.

### How are CSC chambers arranged?

CSC chambers are arranged into 4 different stations, interleaved with the steel of the flux-return yoke.

## Clustering algorithm

DBSCAN(Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a widely-used, generic clustering algorithm.

It has two parameters, `minPts` for minimum points to be a cluster and `dR` for the distance between points. 

For clustering MDS, the rechits are the input points and we are clustering in the `eta-phi` space.

We choose `minPts = 50, dR = 0.2`. `minPts = 50` because it's more than 2x of the typical number of hits created by a muon in CSC(< 24 hits).

> In this diagram, minPts = 4. 
>
> Point A and the other red points are core points, because the area surrounding these points in an ε radius contain at least 4 points (including the point itself). Because they are all reachable from one another, they form a single cluster.
>
> Points B and C are not core points, but are reachable from A (via other core points) and thus belong to the cluster as well. 
>
> Point N is a noise point that is neither a core point nor directly-reachable.

### Cluster properties  

Cluster properties are computed from **constituent** rechits. Here are the descriptions of some key cluster properties:
 - Cluster position: average of input rechit positions
 - Cluster time: average of input rechit wire time and strip time 
 - Cluster nStation10: number of stations with at least 10 input rechits in this cluster
 - Cluster avgStation10: average station number weighted by number of rechits, using stations with at least 10 input rechits
 - Cluster nME11/12: number of rechits coming from ME11 or ME12 in this cluster

> Write code to compute the nME11/12. Complete the function `computeME11_12`.

> ## Exercise: plot cluster properties
