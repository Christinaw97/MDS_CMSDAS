title: "Introduction"
teaching: 30
exercises: 0
questions:
- Why do we search for long-lived particles?
- Why do we use muon detectors?
- What signatures are we looking for?
objectives:
- "Understand the motivation to search for LLPs with muon detectors"
- "Understand the high-multiplicity signature from LLPs due to the unique CMS muon detector design"
- "Have an understanding of the overall analysis strategy and background estimation"
keypoints:
- "Searching for LLPs with the CMS muon detectors that is interleaved with steel return yoke give rise to unique high multiplicity signature that allow us to be sensitive to a broad range of LLP decay modes and to LLP masses below GeV"

We will go through the introductory slides to give you an overview of the motivation to search for LLP with the CMS muon detectors, the analysis strategy, background estimation methods, and limit setting on LLP cross section.
